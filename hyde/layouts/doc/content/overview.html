§§ blurb
Hyde is a static website generator written in python. While Hyde took
life as the [awesome Jekyll][Jekyll]'s evil twin, it has since been
completely consumed by [the dark side][python] to have an identity of its own.

Hyde desires to fulfill the lofty goal of removing the
[pain points][static cons] involved in creating and maintaining
[static websites][static pros].
